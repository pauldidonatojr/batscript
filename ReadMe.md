- If a file is deleted within the directory a notification will appear asking if you want to delete the file or not

- If you hit "yes" it will delete itself

- If you hit "no" it will remain within the directory

- If a new file is created then no dialog box will appear

- I want the dialog box to take control of their screen and prevent them from making any changes until they select "yes or no"

- Once this is completed we will work on moving files

- The same exact concept for when you want to move a file if you move the file then the dialog box will appear taking control of the screen
